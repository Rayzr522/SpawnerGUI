# SpawnerGUI
A Bukkit plugin for purchasing randomized spawners.

_This plugin was done as a request for the **HydrusPvP** server._

#### [Downloads](https://github.com/Rayzr522/SpawnerGUI/releases)

## Installation
Drag and drop SpawnerGUI and CreativelyNamedLib (both found on the [releases page](https://github.com/Rayzr522/SpawnerGUI/releases), CNL is on there till I properly release a version of it on it's own). Run it once, set up your entity types in `config.yml`, and you're good to go!
